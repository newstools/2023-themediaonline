[PRESS OFFICE] In a time when South Africans feel helpless and crippled by load shedding, Openview is once again stepping up as a beacon of light and giving households non-stop entertainment with their favourite shows. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-83489 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/684609.webp?resize=300%2C265&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="265" data-recalc-dims="1"  />The industry-first initiative also adds value to brands and advertisers by repeating their ads on a pop-up channel 18 hours per day, every day. “We’ve got you, South Africa – as a brand of our own, we believe it’s the little things we do to support households that will make a difference in the long run.” Catch it when you catch it, as long as you catch it – with 18 hours daily of local dramas, Power-UP! is the new pop-up channel that ensures viewers never miss a show again – no matter how your load shedding schedule changes. Power-UP! (Channel 114 on Openview) is available from 23 January 2023 and will repeat all the e.tv hit prime-time shows like Durban Gen, House of Zwide, Scandal!, and Imbewu from Monday to Friday, running with two-hour loops. The channel will be on from 6am to midnight every day. The Black Door will repeat on weekends from 11 pm. Afrikaans telenovela true-at-hearts will also not be lost in the dark … Power-UP! will showcase the omnibus repeats of all the best loved Afrikaans dramas on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays). #DisComplicated, Daai Crazy Somer, Die Vertroueling, and more will be available if you missed it during the week due to load shedding. Openview currently powers up more than three million homes with great entertainment! For more information and to see the complete Openview bouquet visit www.openview.co.za.
