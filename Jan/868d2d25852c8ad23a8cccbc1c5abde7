The Media Online’s weekly column delivering news of award wins, entries, competitions, dates to note and winners in the media industry. UCT and Tip Africa score in the South African Corporate Communication Excellence Showcase First runner up, Tip Africa’s Let’s Build a Bank for Capitec The past three years have challenged corporates and publication practitioners in ways not known before. They had to communicate under strange new circumstances brought on by a pandemic while digital development has also leapfrogged, providing new methods and media for communication. The new normal has certainly brought opportunities and innovation. The SA Publication Forum (SAPF) remains a relevant and crucial benchmarking forum for excellence in corporate communication.  This year’s corporate competition is yet again proof of the importance of building a community of practice. 2022’s overall best corporate publication astonished and wowed the judges and moderators. Your Career Guide, created for the University of Cape Town (UCT) by the Cape Town-based agency, GAPdesign, is bulging with incredibly useful and inspiring information and advice. The best corporate publication is chosen from the pool of winners of all 9 categories in the Corporate Publication Competition of a specific year. The two runners-up were both created by another Cape Town-based agency, Tip Africa. The first runner-up, Let’s Build a Bank, tells the history of Capitec – a journey from payday lender through the ‘bank-in-the-boot’ to the financial powerhouse of today. The story is fluidly and compellingly told. The investment in the many, many hours spent interviewing personnel and researching the history really comes through in the wealth of detail, biographical information, and anecdote. Second runner-up, the online annual report of Mediclinic International, is a near-perfect annual report. By employing digital technology, the multi-layered medium of the internet is used to its fullest potential in this remarkable publication. By combining this with innovative design, difficult and dense content is dealt with in an effective manner. Colour, graphics, and good design make information clear, accessible and easy to understand. It conveys vast amounts of information in an easily digestible format. The variety in industries, publications and methods of communicating is proof of the innovation and excellence that exist in the corporate communication industry in South Africa and the SAPF is humbled to be the vehicle for showcasing these examples.
