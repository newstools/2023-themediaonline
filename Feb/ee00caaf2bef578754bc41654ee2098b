The Shop Awards will be launched in March, with the event towards the end of the year that celebrates work that has delivered tangible results and moved the dial meaningfully in the retail space.

SA’s largest DOOH screen launched 1 Feb, & it’s SOLAR Epic Outdoor, a niche media company specialising in the development and marketing of large-format, high-impact static and digital out of home (DOOH) platforms, has announced a new digital billboard site on the N1 highway. The property was specifically designed to accept advertising and at 400m2 the international-standard LED will be the largest roadside LED in South Africa, by far. That’s bigger than two tennis courts! While the concept is similar to screens in London, New York and Dubai, those billboards target pedestrians predominantly. This is a massive roadside digital LED, on a bespoke building that has a run up of more than 800m. It will be impossible to miss. The LED screen is able to cater for all modern OOH creative techniques, including deep motion and anamorphic 3D. “It all adds up to a site with incredible impact. The site ticks every single box, it’s unique in the South African context,” said Rene Hedley, director of Epic Outdoor. Provantage joins DPAA Provantage is currently the only media owner on the continent to have joined the g DOOH community via its membership of the  DPAA. Provantage CEO Jacques Du Preez said this collaboration further strengthens the company’s position as a leader in digital OOH in Africa. “We are the largest digital place-based network provider on the continent which includes rotating digital billboards and our SONAR offering which allows for OOH messaging to further extend its reach into the mobile OOH space. It is therefore advantageous for us to be a part of a global association that will help enhance our digital services. Through this, Provantage will be exposed to global players, thought leaders and innovations, adding impetus to our ongoing efforts of pushing digital boundaries, not only in the South African context, but internationally too.” Street Network launches audience measurement for street furniture formats Street Network, a Provantage company, has partnered with Lightstone, a leader in property and automotive data, to launch a holistic street furniture advertising audience measurement. “The proprietary audience measurement will be critical in helping brands and advertisers connect with targeted consumers, while simultaneously being able to quantify campaign reach and impressions. This strategic investment in data is led by our desire to keep the OOH industry moving forward and constantly innovating,” said John Faia, general manager of Street Network at Provantage. Culture of trust and niche tech focus sees DUO grow 30% year on year A culture of trust is an anomaly in the PR industry,” says Judith Middleton, CEO of DUO. “And so we have consciously nurtured this for a number of years and it is paying dividends now, not just in revenue growing solidly by 30% year on year, but also in the retention and attraction of  talented staff.” She says the key to building this trust is by building an environment where each person works to their strengths, appreciating that inter-dependability, across levels of experience, is crucial to deliver excellent client service. “What you find is that over the years this dependency and investment in core competencies has created an environment where everyone trusts the next person to a point where they are not afraid to be vulnerable. This means there’s real collaboration and perseverance to find the best solutions for each challenge and this positively affects outcomes both for the client and the agency.” Middleton says that the bulk of the agency’s growth has come from growing the existing client pool, as opposed to new client signings. “Times are tougher now, however there was a notable spike in requests for proposals towards the end of the year and we have subsequently signed two new retainer clients in January. However, what really excites me is the growth of our existing book – not because it demonstrates ‘upselling’ for upselling’s sake, but it is a direct result of an important strategic digital shift we embarked on a few years ago,” she explains. Jacaranda FM and Pretoria Capitals T20 cricket team partner for exciting innings at SA20 Jacaranda FM has announced its support for another local sports team as Pretoria Capitals cricket team hit the crease for their first tournament against Sunrisers Eastern Cape yesterday in the SA20. “The opportunity to support Pretoria Capitals is an extension of our existing sponsorship strategy to sponsor local sports teams in Gauteng, and give this new and exciting cricket tournament the commercial support they need to thrive,” said Jane Ruinard, Commercial Manager at Jacaranda FM.

The 2022 group has successfully completed the programme, and is set to advance their careers within the organisation and in the industry; the company is looking forward to welcoming the interns of 2023. TBWA\SA Group CEO, Luca Gallarelli, said the result have been tremendous, opening up a healthy and fast-growing pipeline of fit-for-purpose digital and data talent, while also helping accelerate the transformation of the agency collective and industry at large. “Being the disruption company demands that we live in a constant state of restlessness with our orientation always being to reach higher. We realised that getting the right candidates on board with such specialist and rare skills is difficult and expensive, with poaching and competition on the rise. The current problem is that there is a shortage of quality digital and data talent,” explained Gallarelli. The need for performance marketing, end-to-end measurement, e-commerce, and other solutions saw agencies scrambling to meet demand.
