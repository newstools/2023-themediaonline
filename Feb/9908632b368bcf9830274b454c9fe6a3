This week’s BIG move: SABC 1 hits one billion impressions with #SABC1siON campaign <img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-84008 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FpA-OgMXsAEftjI.jpg?resize=200%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="200" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1"  />The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)’s biggest commercial tv station, SABC 1, is pleased to announce that they’ve garnered over one billion social media impressions with their #SABC1siON campaign. Derived from the popular youth terminology of ‘putting someone on’,  the #SABC1siON strap-line was a vibrant and youth-centric approach to engage with SABC 1 viewers. The purpose of which was to reinvigorate the brand and reposition SABC 1 as the channel that is forever ‘switched on’ to the culture, the latest talent, Mzansi content, social media trends etc. and will continue to ‘put people on’ offering the best local video entertainment. The campaign was launched through a TVC on the channel as well as other promotional material, including digital content posted on all the channel’s social media platforms. This campaign has been a tremendous success, with numbers skyrocketing on digital platforms. For the first time ever, SABC 1 accumulated over one billion impressions across all social media platforms. This means people saw the #SABC1siON posts over a billion times between September 2022 and February 2023. To support the TV efforts in communicating this message as well as promoting SABC 1’s summer content, a digital strategy was conceived and the hashtag #SABC1siON was created to accompany all this content. This included a nationwide hip-hop meets AmaPiano competition termed the #SABC1siON Challenge. This competition was just one part of the puzzle leading up to the major success SABC 1’s digital platforms have enjoyed. Blueprint Group conceptualised the social media campaign through their social media agency Bluecloud AI.

Making moves Up close and personal. Nedbank IMC 2023 gets real This year the Nedbank IMC will be hosting an in-person limited seating event for the first time in four years. While the virtual format did  not  dim the impact of Nedbank IMC  – which saw 2 000 delegates from 15 countries gather online last year – 2023’s  hybrid format of in person and online is perfectly in tune with the conference theme of Marketing. Up close and personal. Each year the Nedbank IMC develops a theme reflective of marketing’s current concerns and conversations. This year’s theme Up close and personal has a dual meaning. Following the Nedbank IMC’s in-person hiatus, it’s time to get together once again,  reconnect and forge new connections. It is also a time for marketing to get to know and understand  customers better. Dale Hefer, CEO of Nedbank IMC, says that as today’s customers continue to grow in sophistication and complexity, not knowing our customers can have a material impact on brands.” This year Nedbank IMC delegates can expect the same winning one day, one stage, no less than18 speakers formula. For those familiar with Nedbank IMC, they will – quite rightly – anticipate the high energy and pacy line-up of local and international thought leaders which exemplifies the conference. The event will be held at Urban Brew Studios in Johannesburg on 15 September 2023. Register today. New gender identity and pronoun data options ensure Salesforce products are more inclusive Salesforce recently announced new fields for gender identity and pronoun data in its products. This opt-in enhancement will give organisations more inclusive ways to collect, manage, and utilise data, enabling them to build trust and form deeper connections with their customers. The enhancements will launch two new fields across standard objects representing people on Salesforce — the Lead, Contact, and Person Account objects — enabling customers and their users to select, identify, and capture pronouns and gender identity. By standardising these fields, admins will no longer have to create custom fields for their organisations, enabling them to capture more accurate customer data and deliver quicker time to value. Using the right identifiers is an important way to build trust and drive customer success. But too frequently, data systems and customer relationship tools’ standard options do not capture peoples’ full identity. The new fields will provide businesses with easy, built-in pronoun and gender identity options, while also empowering each customer to tailor fields to best fit their unique needs.
