What better day to launch a new brand identity for a legacy broadcast brand than World Radio Day? That’s what Cape Town’s Good Hope FM and its advertising agency, Joe Public United, decided to do. The 58-year-old radio station’s intent was to “identify the experiences, concerns, hopes and dreams that resonate with audiences, and to connect them with a station that is not only refreshing, distinct, relevant, appealing and vibey, but also offers a substance that is solid and meaningful”. “Good Hope FM is a station for those who are set on asserting their own individuality, embracing and expressing their true, authentic selves in an inclusive and inspiring space where everyone belongs,” said Sewela Sebola, Good Hope FM’s marketing manager. “The station welcomes anyone, from high school and university students, to young working professionals, and those who are young at heart. Our purpose statement is clear cut: To inspire belonging within its community of listeners. A community of unique individuals, united in their diversity through a shared sense of belonging.” <img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" class="wp-image-83863 size-medium alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Good-Hope-FM-logo-blue-on-white-1.jpg?resize=300%2C276&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="276" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Good-Hope-FM-logo-blue-on-white-1.jpg?resize=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Good-Hope-FM-logo-blue-on-white-1.jpg?resize=320%2C294&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Good-Hope-FM-logo-blue-on-white-1.jpg?resize=480%2C441&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Good-Hope-FM-logo-blue-on-white-1.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"  /> “In recognising our listeners’ uniqueness and originality, the Good Hope FM and Joe Public team drew parallels between the station and them. “We are a station with our own, original flavour – elevating, evolving and boldly owning our originality, while proudly representing our community of listeners through music, content and activities that inform, entertain, educate, engage, connect, inspire, uplift and empower people across Cape Town,” said business manager, JD Mostert. These core values, purpose and tagline underpin Good Hope FM’s new logo, a unique, distinctive monogram which combines the G for ‘Good’ and H for ‘Hope’ into an impactful, circular design – one that will be turned into a viewfinder in some of the station’s visual elements, placing the very community it celebrates at the heart of the brand, capturing the rhythm and originality of the city and community. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-83864 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GHFM-podcast-Kyeezi.jpg?resize=700%2C527&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="527" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GHFM-podcast-Kyeezi.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GHFM-podcast-Kyeezi.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GHFM-podcast-Kyeezi.jpg?resize=320%2C241&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GHFM-podcast-Kyeezi.jpg?resize=480%2C361&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GHFM-podcast-Kyeezi.jpg?resize=45%2C35&amp;ssl=1 45w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1"  /> Want to continue this conversation on The Media Online platforms?
