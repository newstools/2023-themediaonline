The Media Online’s weekly round up of people, account and business moves in media. This week’s BIG move: New-look VISI melds African and global design influences Building on VISI’s 2022 accolades – among them, golds in New York for Art Direction at The Folio: Eddie & Ozzie Awards and Best Use of Photography at the Pearl Awards – VISI’s acclaimed creative director, Mark Serra, has reimagined the brand’s identity with a new masthead and overall cover design. “Mark’s approach to design is always fundamentally about telling a story – and then adding that wow factor. This only happens by being bold, brave, dynamic and graphic, and complementing it with an even balance of white space. I think with the new logo we have achieved that – VISI’s new brand identity is a wonderful celebration of South African design,” said VISI’s editor in chief, Steve Smith. Smith added: “As VISI has consistently shown on its beautifully designed pages, contemporary African design is having a huge impact on global creatives. It’s been so inspiring to see not only how well it sits alongside its global counterparts, but more than that, how design out of Africa brings a wonderfully fresh angle.” Launched in 1998, VISI is a celebration of living well, with a highly discerning, design-conscious audience. Top-quality images, writing by some of the country’s best journalists and industry insiders, and creative layouts mean that every 200-page issue is a collector’s edition. Special issues such as VISI Kitchens and VISI Bathrooms, inspirational social media and newsletters, and an e-commerce store round out the brand’s offering. VISI #124 is the first issue to feature the brand’s new look and is on shelves in most major retailers across South Africa. Visit for more information.
