Grant will host the ceremony and Alison Hammond will host a new BAFTA Studio from the Royal Festival Hall as part of an expanded show format for 2023. This year the red carpet will be hosted by Ali Plumb and Vick Hope. South Africa is strongly represented at this year’s awards with Living, directed by Cape Town’s Oliver Hermanus (The Endless River, Moffie), nominated in four categories, including Outstanding British Film, Leading Actor for Bill Nighy, Best Adapted Screenplay for novelist Kazuo Ishiguro and EE Rising Star Award for Aimee Lou Wood. “At BritBox International, we showcase and celebrate incredible talent, creativity, and storytelling from the UK, every single day, for our viewers,” said Reemah Sakaan, CEO of BritBox International. “BritBox and BAFTA share a common vision to celebrate British excellence on screen, and take it to the world. We are thrilled to be extending our relationship, bringing live awards coverage of the EE BAFTAs ceremony, plus red carpet entertainment, to millions of BritBox subscribers in eight countries globally.” Radio Workshop Podcast Nominated for International Ambie Award Radio Workshop’s I Will Not Grow Old Here series is the first African podcast to be shortlisted at the Podcast Academy’s Ambie Awards, an annual event aimed at celebrating excellence in podcasting. Episodes have been nominated for Best Documentary, a category that honours non-fiction shows, presenting a truthful account of an event, person or topic. The awards ceremony will be held live at the International Theater in Las Vegas, US on 7 March 2023. I Will Not Grow Old Here, comprising three parts, chronicles the daily life of Mary-Ann Nobele, a 23-year-old resident of Alexandria (Alex), a township (informal settlement) located in Johannesburg. It provides listeners with a unique glimpse into her current reality. In-depth interviews with Mary-Ann’s family and friends poses difficult questions around how youth are expected to succeed in “a place like Alex”, especially against the backdrop of a staggering unemployment rate. Content also places a spotlight on the ‘invisible line’ between wealth and poverty, aptly illustrated by the main road that separates Alex and the affluent suburb of Sandton. “We are proud to not only be recognised on an international stage but to also represent South Africa and the continent as a whole,” says Lesedi Mogoatlhe, editorial director at Radio Workshop. “The podcast was born out of our youth radio project at Alex FM (a community radio station in South Africa), which for over ten years, has asked tough questions about the most pressing issues young people face. Our ongoing aim is to create content about, and for, marginalised and underrepresented groups, bringing to light difficult topics and conversations in order to drive sustainable change.” Joe Public Retains Top Spot as SA’s Number One Agency for the 5th Consecutive Year at the 2022 Loeries Joe Public is the top-ranked agency in South Africa for the fifth consecutive year as well as the second Overall Agency of the Year in Africa and the Middle East (AME) in the 2022 Loeries Official Rankings.
